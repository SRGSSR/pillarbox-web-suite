# Contributing

Thank you very much for your interest in contributing to our project! As a public service company,
we want to shape a product that better matches our user needs and desires. Ideas or direct
contributions are therefore warmly welcome and will be considered with great care, provided they
fulfill a few requirements listed in this document. Please read it first before you decide to
contribute.

## Purpose

We aim to evaluate needs and code submissions as efficiently as possible. Since the Pillarbox web
suite is a collaborative effort across multiple contributors and teams, following these contribution
guidelines helps us streamline reviews and maintain consistency.

You should also read or our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), providing
a few guidelines to keep interactions as respectful as possible.

## Scope and Ownership

The Pillarbox web suite is a collaborative effort involving multiple teams. No single team owns the
entire suite, and contributions come from various stakeholders.

## Contributions we are looking for

Any kind of contribution is welcome, as long as it improves the overall quality of our product, for
example:

* Requests for new features or ideas.
* Bug reports or fixes.
* Documentation improvements.
* Translation improvements.

Contributions can either take the form of simple issues where you describe the problem you face or
what you would like to see in our products. If you feel up to the challenge, you can submit code via
pull requests, which will be reviewed by the Pillarbox team and other maintainers involved in this
shared effort.

## Contributions we are not looking for

Requests which are too vague or not related to our product will not be taken into account. We also
have no editorial influence, any issue related to the content available on our platform will simply
be closed.

This repository focuses specifically on components related to video.js and Pillarbox only.
Contributions unrelated to these components or outside this scope are unlikely to be accepted.

## Making a contribution

You can use issues to report bugs, submit ideas or request features. People with a programming
background can also submit changes directly via pull requests. Creating issues or pull requests
requires you to own or [open](https://github.com/join) a GitHub account.

If you are not sure about the likelihood of a change you propose to be accepted, please open an
issue first. We can discuss it there, especially whether it is compatible with our product or not.
This way you can avoid creating an entire pull request we will never be able to merge.

Templates are available when you want to contribute:

* [Issues](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-web-demo/issues/new/choose): Please follow our issue
  template. You can omit information which does not make sense but, in general, the more details you
  can provide, the better. This ensures we can quickly reproduce the problem you are facing,
  increasing the likelihood we can fix it.
* [Pull requests](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-web-demo/compare): Please follow our code
  conventions, test your code well, and write unit tests when this makes sense. We will review your
  work and, if successful, merge it back into the main development branch.

## Code conventions

While there are no formal, rigid code conventions in place, we strive to maintain a consistent
codebase across all contributors and teams involved in the Pillarbox web suite. Please follow the
existing style and patterns you observe in the code to ensure your changes integrate smoothly with
the shared components.

## Code review

Pull requests will be reviewed by members of the Pillarbox team and other contributors involved in
maintaining the shared components. Depending on the complexity of the changes, multiple review
cycles may be needed to ensure quality and compatibility. Approved pull requests will be rebased and
merged into the main development branch and included in the next release.
