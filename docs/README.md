# Pillarbox Web Suite

![Pillarbox logo](README-images/logo.jpg)

This repository is a comprehensive suite of plugins, themes, and components designed to boost the
experience of the [pillarbox-web](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-web) player.

These tools provide versatile options for customization and enhancement tailored to meet your needs.

## Requirements

To use the components in this suite, you need the following installed on your system:

- Node.js

## Quick Start

To get started with this suite, clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-web-suite.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Start the server:

```shell
npm run start
```

### Adding a new element

Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run create
```

After running the command, you will be prompted to enter the type and name of your element. A new
element directory will be generated in the monorepo with the following structure:

```
/packages/<your-element-name>
|-- src
|   |-- lang                        # Folder containing localization files (only if selected)
|   `-- <your-element-name>.js      # Main JavaScript file for the element
|-- test
|   `-- <your-element-name>.test.js # A default vitest test for your element
|-- .babelrc                        # Babel configuration specific to this element
|-- index.html                      # Demo page to showcase the element
|-- package.json                    # NPM package file, you might need to install additional dependencies
|-- README.md                       # Documentation file for the element
|-- vite.config.lib.js              # Vite configuration for building the element as a library
`-- vite.config.js                  # Vite configuration for building the element demo page
```

After the structure is generated, navigate into the element's directory:

```bash
cd packages/your-element-name
```

The README.md file included in your element's directory provides detailed instructions on building
and testing the element.

Contributions are welcome! The Pillarbox web suite is a common effort maintained collaboratively â€”
no single team owns the entire suite. This repository focuses exclusively on components
