### Setting up a development server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:4200`. Open this URL in your browser to view the
demo page.

The video player (`player`) and the Pillarbox library (`pillarbox`) are exposed on the `window`
object, making it easy to access and manipulate from the browser's developer console for debugging.

#### Available URL parameters

The demo page supports several URL parameters that modify the behavior of the video player:

- `debug`: Set this to enable debugging mode.
- `ilHost`: Specifies the host for the data provider.
- `language`: Sets the language for the player interface.
- `urn`: Specifies the URN of the video to load. Default is `urn:rts:video:14683290`.

You can combine parameters in the URL like so:

```plaintext
http://localhost:4200/?language=fr&urn=urn:rts:video:14318206
```
