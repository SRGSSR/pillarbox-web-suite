# Pillarbox Web: SkipButton

A custom component that extends the pillarbox-web player allowing users to skip certain parts of the
video content, such as opening credits or end credits, by listening to
the [`srgssr/interval` event](https://srgssr.github.io/pillarbox-web/api/tutorial-Events.html#srgssr%2Finterval-event).

## Requirements

To use this component, you need the following installed on your system:

- Node.js

## Quick Start

To get started with this component, follow these steps:

Add the `@srgssr` registry to your `.npmrc` file:

```plaintext
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=TOKEN
@srgssr:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Generate an authentication token by following this
guide: [Authenticating with a personal access token][generate-token]

You can now install it through `npm` the following command:

```bash
npm install --save @srgssr/pillarbox-web @srgssr/skip-button
```

For instructions on setting up Pillarbox, see
the [Quick Start guide](SRGSSR/pillarbox-web#quick-start).

Once the player is installed you can activate the button as follows:

```javascript
import Pillarbox from '@srgssr/pillarbox-web';
import '@srgssr/skip-button';

const player = new Pillarbox('my-player', { SkipButton: true });
player.src({
  src: 'urn:swi:video:48115940',
  type: 'srgssr/urn'
});
```

To apply the default styling, add the following line to your CSS file:

```css
@import "@srgssr/skip-button/dist/skip-button.min.css";
```

### Setting up a development server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:4200`. Open this URL in your browser to view the
demo page.

The video player (`player`) and the Pillarbox library (`pillarbox`) are exposed on the `window`
object, making it easy to access and manipulate from the browser's developer console for debugging.

#### Available URL parameters

The demo page supports several URL parameters that modify the behavior of the video player:

- `debug`: Set this to enable debugging mode.
- `ilHost`: Specifies the host for the data provider.
- `language`: Sets the language for the player interface.
- `urn`: Specifies the URN of the video to load. Default is `urn:rts:video:14683290`.

You can combine parameters in the URL like so:

```plaintext
http://localhost:4200/?language=fr&urn=urn:rts:video:14318206
```
